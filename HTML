(1) What are inline and block elements in HTML and the difference between them? Name a few inline elements and blocke elements

In HTML, elements can be either inline or block level elements.

Block level elements, such as <div>, <p>, and <h1>, create a block of content that takes up the full width of its parent container, and creates a new line after it.

Inline elements, such as <span>, <a>, and <img>, only take up as much width as necessary and do not create a new line after them.

Some examples of block level elements are: <div>, <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <form>

Some examples of inline elements are: <a>, <img>, <span>, <button>, <input>, <label>

The <img> tag is used to embed images in an HTML document. The most important attributes are:

alt: provides alternative text for the image, important for accessibility and SEO
width and height: specify the dimensions of the image in pixels
style: sets CSS styles for the image
class and id: assign a class or id to the image, which can be used for styling or JavaScript
usemap: specifies the name of a client-side image map to use with the image
ismap: specifies that the image is a server-side image map

To create lists in HTML, use the <ol> element for ordered lists (numbered) and the <ul> element for unordered lists (bulleted). Nest <li> elements inside for each list item. To create nested lists, nest a <ul> or <ol> element inside a <li> element. You can also use <dl> element for a list of terms and their definitions. Lists can be styled using CSS by targeting the <ol>, <ul>, <li>, <dt>, and <dd> elements.

(4) How to interlink web pages and navigate people to other websites?

The <a> (anchor) tag is used to create hyperlinks in HTML to navigate between web pages or other websites. To link to another web page use the href attribute with the URL of the web page. To link to another website use the full URL in the href attribute. The target attribute can be used to control how the link is opened, like opening in a new tab. To link to a specific location on the same page or another page, use the id attribute on the element you want to link to and specify the id in the href attribute preceded by "#". It is important to use clear and meaningful link text that describes the destination of the link for accessibility and SEO.
